# Week_8_Final_Project_Covid_19_Global_Data_Tracker

#COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

#Project Description

The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a data analysis project designed to track and visualize global trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using real-world data, the project analyzes key metrics such as total cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time. The final output is a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook combining code, visualizations, and insights.


#Project Objectives

Import and clean COVID-19 global data from trusted sources

Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time

Compare COVID-19 metrics across selected countries or regions

Visualize trends using charts and maps for clearer understanding

Summarize key findings and present insights in a well-documented notebook


#Tools and Libraries Used

Python

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly (for choropleth map)

Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)


#How to Run the Project

Download the OWID COVID-19 dataset and save it as owid-covid-data.csv in your working directory.

Open the notebook covid19_data_tracker.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Run each cell step-by-step to:

Load and clean the data

Perform exploratory data analysis

Generate charts and visualizations

View the choropleth map (optional; requires Plotly)

Read insights and observations documented in markdown cells.


#Insights & Reflections

There are significant differences in how countries responded to the pandemic, especially in vaccination rollouts.

The death rate provides context to total case numbers, revealing countries with better health system responses.

Data gaps and inconsistencies highlight the importance of clean and standardized public health reporting.

Visualizations such as line charts and maps make it easier to identify trends and outliers.
